# The A Team Profile Generator

  ## Description
  
 This was an assignment for Coding bootcamp to develope a Team Profile Generator that deveolps an html file through the command line.   I created a  basic html template, and then connected in to my generateHTML file with JavaScript.  I created an index.js file with the needed question to to ask the user.    I created constructors for the manager and employees.  I connected them together to run in node.js in order for the page to be devolped through the questions in the command line.
